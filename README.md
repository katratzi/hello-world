You would make a ship sail against the wind and current by lighting a bonfire under her deck?  I have no time for such nonsense.

- can create local branches and push them to git and they'll be created there
- use the view>command palette for some git commands
- git delete branch is handy
- git fetch (prune) to clear up origin/branches once deleted
